## About Me

Hey there! I'm HarbingerOfFire, a self-taught back-end developer with a passion for security, encryption, and Python. When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you can usually find me exploring the latest trends in cybersecurity or tinkering with new encryption algorithms.

### Key Skills

- **Security:** Building robust systems with security in mind is my forte. From implementing encryption protocols to ensuring data integrity, I thrive on keeping things secure.
  
- **Encryption:** I love diving into the intricate world of encryption. Whether it's cracking hashes or designing new encryption standards, I'm always up for a cryptographic challenge.
  
- **Python:** Python is my weapon of choice when it comes to building powerful back-end systems. Anything you can think of, I can do it in python.

### Notable Projects

- **[Passploit](https://github.com/HarbingerOfFire/Passploit):** Ever heard of Hashcat? Well, Passploit is its Python counterpart. With Passploit, cracking hashes and testing password security has never been easier.

- **[RES](https://github.com/HarbingerOfFire/RES):** In a world where data privacy is paramount, RES provides a novel approach to encryption. Developed entirely by yours truly, it's my humble contribution to the world of cryptography.

- **[BivittatusDB](https://github.com/HarbingerOfFire/bivittatusDB):** Tired of traditional database management systems? BivittatusDB offers a fresh perspective with its operator-based approach to managing data.

### Experience

With over 1.5 years of hands-on experience in the field, I've honed my skills and gained valuable insights into the world of back-end development and cybersecurity.

### Goals

In the next year, I'm aiming to bolster my expertise by obtaining a couple of certifications in cybersecurity and advanced Python programming.
I'm also looking into Post-Quantum Cryptography, and I'll likely post a few repos on that as well.

### Let's Connect!

While I don't have any social media profiles at the moment, you can always find me here on GitHub. Stay tuned for updates, I might launch a personal website soon!
